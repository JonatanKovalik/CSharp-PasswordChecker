## üìú Project Overview

This `CSharp-PasswordChecker` is a simple console application developed in C# that validates user-inputted passwords based on a set of predefined criteria. It serves as a foundational project to demonstrate basic programming concepts such as user input handling, conditional logic, and string manipulation in a practical context.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Password Input:** Prompts the user to enter a password.
* **Criteria-Based Validation:** Checks the password against configurable rules (e.g., minimum length, presence of uppercase letters, numbers, special characters).
* **Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback to the user on whether the password meets the criteria and highlights specific unmet requirements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET [Version, e.g., .NET 6.0 Console App]
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/CSharp-PasswordChecker.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/CSharp-PasswordChecker.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Visual Studio:** Open the `CSharp-PasswordChecker.sln` solution file in Visual Studio 2022.
3.  **Build and Run:** Press `F5` or click "Start Debugging" to compile and run the application. The program will execute in a console window.

## üß† Learning & Challenges

Developing this project helped me solidify my understanding of [mention specific learning, e.g., `if-else` statements, `string` methods, regular expressions (if used)]. A particular challenge was [describe a specific challenge, e.g., handling edge cases for password rules, structuring the validation logic efficiently], which I addressed by [explain your solution, e.g., breaking down the validation into smaller, testable functions].
